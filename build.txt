it is not preferable to call the api multiple times instead use tha latest to update the data instead of calling for each individual station 

use the since filter

use the standard http redirects if something unforeseen happens the standard protocals will be used 


the app should do the following things 


Using the Real Time flood-monitoring API (https://environment.data.gov.uk/flood-
monitoring/doc/reference) provided by the Environmental Agency, please produce a tool (web
page, script, desktop application etc.) that:
·
Provides some control to select an individual measurement station.
·
Once a singular station is selected, shows a line graph (with associated table) of that station’s
readings over the last 24 hours.





Please try to create the tool with user-experience and professional software development standards
in mind. If you are successful in this stage, you will progress to an informal interview.
